# Upkeep and Maintenance Procedures for the Compact Compton Imager II

CCI-2 is a gamma-ray imaging device based on planar high purity germanium
(HPGe) detectors with segmented orthogonal-strip multipolarity sensing 
electrodes.
As the system includes HPGe detectors, additional training in vacuum systems 
and cryogenics is required to keep the detector in working order.
In addition, the 152 channels of the segmented electrodes are instrumented with
discrete charge-sensitive preamplifiers.
These preamplifiers do not have any form of input protection circuitry, and are
thus easily damaged during unforeseen operational events, such as power loss
or large transients on the signal lines.

This repository is to serve as an archive for documentation and procedures
related to the maintenance of CCI-2.
The documentation is split into three main areas:
 1. Cryogenics (working with the liquid nitrogen)
 2. Vacuum (attaining/maintaining vacuum in the detector cryostat)
 3. Front-end electronics (procedures for the repair of preamplifiers)

The entries in this archive are intended to be "living documents" - as 
maintenance procedures are modified, or new procedures added, please submit
updated documentation via pull request.
Additionally, issues will be actively monitored.
Problems with the system related to these procedures should be raised via the
GH issues mechanism.
