# CCI-2 150L Dewar Exchange Procedure

The document describes the procedure for replacing the 150L LN<sub>2</sub>
used to fill the smaller 30L dewar mounted on the CCI-2 cart.
During normal operation, the 150L dewar typically needs to be replaced once
every two to three weeks depending on the initial fill-level of the 150L dewar.

## PPE

The following PPE are required to move/replace the 150L dewars:
 - Long pants (reuired for 1140 access)
 - Close-toed shoes (required for 1140 access)

To attach/detach dewars from CCI-2, you must wear additional PPE for
cryogenic work:
 - Long-sleeved lab coat
 - Insulated gloves
 - Chem-goggles (or other eyewear that fits snugly over your eyes)
 - *Optional* Plastic face-shield

## Safety Hazards

The 150 LN<sub>2</sub> dewars are quite heavy when full and difficult to 
maneuver.
When moving the dewar, make sure to take steps to mitigate the potential 
hazards associated with moving an object that can weigh more than 200 pounds.
It is strongly recommended that at least two people be present for this 
procedure so that help is readily accessible if something goes wrong.
Be especially careful when moving a full dewar down the loading bay ramp.
**When moving dewars up and down the ramp, always make sure that you are on
  the uphill side of the incline from the dewar!**
Similarly, make sure that no one is working near the bottom of the loading bay
ramp in 1140 when moving dewars.
Again, it is a good idea to have two people present so that someone can monitor
the bottom of the loading bay and keep people from walking in the are when
the dewars are being transferred.

## General Considerations

The 150L dewars are delivered to the atrium outside of 1110B Etcheverry hall
on a weekly basis.
The dewars are chained against the wall when in storage to mitigate the risk
of them tipping over during an earthquake.
The 150L dewars are transported by way of a specialized, 6-wheel dolly.
The dolly should be stored in the atrium outside 1110B near the 150L dewars.
If there is a problem with the dolly (e.g. a flat tire), contact the lab
safety coordinator so that it can be fixed before you attempt to use it.

### Using the dolly

To mount a 150L dewar onto the dolly, tip the dolly so that it is vertically
aligned with the dewar, and insert the hook on the upper portion of the dolly
through the corresponding eyelet on the upper rim of the dewar.
Note that the height of the eyelet may vary between dewars, so the height of
the hook may need to be adjusted.
Once the hook is through the eyelet, the dolly should rest vertically against
the dewar in an upright position.
Next, attached the red safety belt around the 150L dewar and hook it on to
the opposite side of the dolly.
Tighten the belt like an airplane seatbelt.
Finally, insert a the chain at the top of the dolly around the top ring of the
150L dewar, and attach it to the eyelet on the other side of the dolly.
When un-mounting the dewar, follow the above procedure in reverse.

### Determining the fill-level of the 150L dewars

There are two ways to determine whether or not the 150L dewars are full.
Each of the 150 L dewars has a "fill gauge", typically found under the 
dome-shaped capsule on the top of the dewar.
The shape and reliability of these gauges vary widely from dewar to dewar, but
generally they consist of a vertical metallic indicator within a glass 
viewport.
The height of the indicator within the viewport is supposed to indicate the
relative fill level.
For example, if the indicator covers the bottom half of the viewport, the
dewar is half full.
It is often very difficult to see the indicators and they are not necessarily
too reliable.

The fill-level of a dewar can also be determined (albeit after a bit of 
experience) with the "tilt test".
By applying a bit of upward force to the ring on top of the 150L dewar, you 
will be able to sense how easily the dewar tilts back. 
If the dewar is nearly empty, the dewar will tilt relatively easily, wheras a
full dewar will hardly tilt at all.
**Be careful when doing this test - do not push so hard as to risk tipping the
  dewar over!**
If you are unsure about this, see if you can catch one of the LN<sub>2</sub>
delivery guys - they will be happy to show you all the tricks related to 
the large dewars

### Selecting a 150L Dewar

Remember, the full dewar should be pressurized to about 22 PSI. 
Check the pressure gauge on the dewar to verify this is the case.
If the dewar is full but the pressure is indicated to be <14 or >26 PSI, notify
the lab contact.

We are not the only people who use the LN<sub>2</sub> stored in the 1110B 
atrium.
Avoid taking dewars that already have cryo-hoses connected to them.
These are typically used to fill the various coaxial HPGe detectors in 1110B/C.
In the event that you can't find any full dewars in the 1110B atrium,
contact the lab contact immediately.

## Procedure

The procedure for replacing an empty 150L dewar with a full one is described
below.

### 1. Detactching the Empty 150L Dewar from CCI-2

**Note: full LN<sub>2</sub> PPE should be worn for this procedure**

 1. Ensure that the "liquid" valve on the 150L dewar is completely closed
 2. Using the wrench, loosen the cryo-hose from the valve stem of the 150L 
    dewar.
 3. Once the connection has been loosened, you can continue to unscrew the 
    cryo-hose by hand (assuming you are wearing cryo-gloves)
 4. Remove the hose from the 150L dewar and rest it on the CCI-2 cart.

### 2. Transporting a Full Dewar

 1. Open the bay doors to 1140 - ensure there is no one working near the
    bottom of the loading ramp.
 2. In the 1110B atrium, hook up the dolly to a full dewar as described above.
 3. *Carefully* transport the full dewar down the loading-bay ramp and to 
    CCI-2 in 1140.
 4. Unmount the full dewar from the dolly
    - Note: make sure that the "liquid" valve on the full dewar can be reached
      by the CCI-2 cryo-hose.

### 3. Remove the Empty Dewar

 1. With the full dewar removed from the dolly, mount the empty on to the dolly
    as described above.
 2. Move the empty up the loading bay ramp and back to the 1110B atrium.
 3. Remove the 150L dewar from the cart, and make sure that it is stored 
    against the wall and held in place using the chains
    - Note: It does not matter which "slot" the empties are returned to.
 4. Store the dolly in the 1110B atrium.
 5. Head back down the loading ramp to 1140 and close the bay doors.

### 4. Hook up the New Dewar to CCI-2

**Note: full LN<sub>2</sub> PPE should be worn for this procedure**

 1. Find the "liquid" valve on the 150L dewar.
 2. Attach the cryo-hose to the "liquid" valve. Screw down the cryo-hose until
    the connection is finger-tight.
 3. Take the wrench and tighten the connection between the cryo-hose and the
    "liquid" valve.
    - Note: It doesn't have to be *super* tight - on the order of a half turn
      of the wrench is usually sufficient.
 4. Double check that the pressure gauge on the dewar reads about 22 PSI.
 5. Verify everything is connected properly by slowly opening the "liquid" 
    valve on the 150L dewar.
    You should see vapor coming out of the stem on the fill collar of the 30L
    dewar, and no vapor should be coming out of the cryo-hose at the point 
    where it is connected to the 150L dewar.
