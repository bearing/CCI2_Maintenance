# CCI-2 LN<sub>2</sub> Fill Procedure

This document describes the procedure for filling the 30L dewar on the CCI-2
cart with LN<sub>2</sub> from the larger 150L dewar.

## PPE

To fill the detector, you will need the following PPE:
 - Long pants (required for 1140 access)
 - Close-toed shoes (required for 1140 access)
 - Long-sleeved lab coat
 - Insulated gloves
 - Chem-goggles (or other eyewear that fits snuggly over your eyes)
 - *Optional* Plastic face-shield

## Safety Hazards

There are several hazards associated with working with LN<sub>2</sub>. 
The most serious is the risk of assphyxiation from significant release of
LN<sub>2</sub> in poorly ventilated, small volume rooms.
This is not a concern in 1140 Etcheverry, though it is an important thing to
remember when using LN<sub>2</sub> in other environments.
The second risk is that of "cryo-burns" damage to skin and other sensitive 
tissue from prolonged, direct contact with the LN<sub>2</sub> or pieces of
equipment at cryogenic temperatures.
PPE for your eyes and face are especially important to ensure that the 
LN<sub>2</sub> never contacts these sensitive areas.
Long sleeves and pants and the long cryogloves that cover at least to the elbow
are usually sufficient protection from LN<sub>2</sub> touching exposed skin.
The greatest risk in this regard is from LN<sub>2</sub> getting *inside* of
a garment and pooling, initiating prolonged contact with your skin.
For example, if LN<sub>2</sub> somehow gets inside the cryo-gloves.
If this happens, remove the gloves quickly (they are designed to come off
easily with a sharp downward motion).
Similar precautions apply to other garments where pooling is possible, such as
shoes.

## General Considerations

The thermal isolation between the fill collar and the outside of the CCI-2
cryostat is poor.
As a result, if the LN<sub>2</sub> is left flowing for too long, temperature
differences can build up on the *outside* of the cryostat and cause the
vacuum to be compromised.
**To avoid this situation, limit the amount of time that the liquid valve is
left open to 3 minutes or less**.
If you notice a buildup of frost on the outside of the cryostat nearest the 
fill collar, stop filling immediately and wait for the cryostat to warm up.
This is especially important when filling the dewar up from empty, following
a scheduled warm-up for example.
Long fills like this should be broken up into two sessions to avoid issues with
thermal stresses on the cryostat.

## Procedure

 1. Make sure you are wearing all of your PPE
 2. Verify that the cryohose is attached to the nozzle labeled "liquid" on the
    150 L dewar.
    - Note: This is usually indicated on a metal tag attached to the valve 
            stem, though occasionally it is written on the dewar itself under
            the stem.
 3. Verify that the cryohose connection to the 150L is tight.
 4. Double check the pressure guage at the pressure-relief valve. The pressure
    should be around 22 PSI
    - **If the pressure reads >28 PSI - Stop the filling procedure!**
      Excessive fill pressure can actually cause LN<sub>2</sub> that is already
      in the 30L dewar to be evacuated, uncovering the dipstick and resulting 
      in temporary loss of cooling.
      If you encounter this scenario, replace the 150L dewar with a new one and
      notify the lab contact to raise the issue with the LN<sub>2</sub> 
      provider.
    - If the pressure reads <14 PSI, there is not a significant enough 
      pressure differential to force LN<sub>2</sub> from the 150L dewar into
      the 30L dewar.
      If the 150L dewar still indicates that it is full, ensure that any "vent"
      valves are firmly closed and that the 22 PSI relief valve is not faulty
      (e.g. stuck open even when the pressure gauge indicates <22 PSI).
      If the pressure remains <14 PSI, the 150L dewar is either empty or faulty
      and needs to be replaced.
 5. Having verified all the above, open the "liquid" valve by turning the knob
    in a counter clockwise direction until vapor is seen flowing out the stem
    in the fill collar of the 30L dewar.
    - Note: You do not have to completely open the valve (i.e. turn the knob
      counterclockwise until you no longer can).
      The flow rate should remain constant once the valve is sufficiently 
      opened - typically requiring only 2 or 3 full counter-clockwise turns.
 6. Monitor the output of the stem in the fill collar of the 30L dewar.
    The filling can be terminated (i.e. the valve closed) when LN<sub>2</sub>
    is being emitted from the stem (as opposed to vapor only).
 7. If using a fill log (recommended), make sure to record the date, time, and
    temperature after you have closed the "liquid" valve.
